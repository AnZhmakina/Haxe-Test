# Haxe-Test

Realized interface with 3 tabs and navigation between them using Haxe, libraries FeathersUI for UI components and openfl. 

The content of the panels looks as a 4x4 grid. Each grid cell is a button with a name. When the button is clicked, a Message Box with the name of the button is displayed. A grid cell looks like a button with a picture. Clicking on a grid cell opens the same screen view that uses its values from the XML file.

For the correct work of the application should be installed Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio and Haxe.

Code and a project file for FlashDevelop locate in the directory 'Haxe-Test-FlashDevelop'. The application was compiled using Neko.
